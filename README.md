## Learning objectives  

* To make a good, smart use of HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap  
* To be working as a group towards the creation of a realistic restaurant website  
* To leverage countless new options (e.a. Bootstrap's components) to render it modern and responsive

## My part  

I was in charge of the part dedicated to the restaurant in itself, meaning I had to gather schedules, locations and a map in the most relevant way. I went for a layout allowing to provide said information in cards added to a dropdown button at the bottom thereof. Though I must practice to fully master such glitches, I find it efficient communication-wise. :memo:
